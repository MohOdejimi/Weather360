# How it's made:
 Tech used: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
 
 Weather360 utilizes the OpenWeatherApI to handle users requests. The current weather api and 5 -days forecast api were used in displaying the current weather information and a forecast for the coming 5 days. 
 
 # Optimizations: 

 The project was optimized to provide users with the opportunity to search for cities with the enter keyword. I initially created a button that will allow users to request for data at the instant of a click but I refactored it to allow the enter key to fetch for the weather data as I beleieve it will provide user with a seamless and hitch free means of using the application.
 
 # Lessons Learned: 
 
 with this project, I was able to grasp the full details and functions of the Javascript date object and its functionalities. I learnt how it can be used to check thorugh different timezones in thw world
